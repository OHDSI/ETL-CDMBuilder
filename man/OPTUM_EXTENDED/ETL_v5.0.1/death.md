# CDM Table: DEATH

The *DEATH* table is designed to capture the time when a person is
deceased and cause of death. Death in Optum Extended SES/DOD can be
captured by discharge status “Died” or condition in one of the various
diagnosis fields containing codes indicating death in the
**MEDICAL_CLAIMS** table. This table should be loaded when building
*VISIT_OCCURRENCE* table. The DOD database has additional death
information sourced from Social Security Master File.

Key conventions:

-   Starts from the **TEMP_MEDICAL** table generated throughout the
    *VISIT_OCCURRENCE* creation.

-   The date of death will be associated to the VISIT_END_DATE.

-   There are five ways to identify death: discharge status, ICD10s, ICD9s, DRGs, and (if using Extended DOD) the death table.

**DRGs**

For DRGs, use the following query.  DRGs are date-sensitve so you need to only pick up DRGs that fall within the valid start and end dates.

```
SELECT CONCEPT_ID, CONCEPT_NAME, CONCEPT_CODE, valid_start_date, valid_end_date
FROM concept
WHERE CONCEPT_ID IN (
  38000421,38001111,38001112,38001113
)
```
**(DOD Only) pulling data from the DOD_DEATH table.**

-   Only one record will be kept for each patient; use the following
    hierarchy to determine which record to use

    1.  ***(DOD Only)*** Death recorded in **DEATH** table
    2.  Death captured by discharge status
    3.  Death captured by DRGs
    4.  Death captured by ICD9 or ICD10 diagnosis codes.
        1.  If ICD_FLAG = 9 then use the ICD9 codes
        2.  If ICD_FLAG = 10 then use the ICD10 codes

-   After determining which table or code the death should come from
    take the record with the latest date of death.

-   If there are health care visits after 30 days of death date, delete
    the death record.

-   If the death date occurs after the patient's date of birth, then
    delete the death record.
