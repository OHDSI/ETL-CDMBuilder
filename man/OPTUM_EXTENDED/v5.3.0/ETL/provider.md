# CDM Table: PROVIDER

The PROVIDER table contains a list of uniquely identified health care
providers (physicians). Optum does have some provider information in
**RX_CLAIMS** and **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** tables. However, some of the
providers listed by Optum may also be considered care sites or
organizations. Since there is no clear way to decipher between all items
identified as providers by Optum, all of them will be added to this
table, regardless if they are truly organizations or care sites.

**Key conventions:**

-   DEA and NPI are encrypted in **RX_CLAIMS** table.
-   PROV is the provider ID in **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** table but cannot be
    linked to DEA or NPI, so we will keep it as
    PROVIDER_SOURCE_VALUE too.
-   Provider Specialty (PROVCAT) is available in **MEDICAL_CLAIMS** table.
    -   We added mapping of Optum provider specialty to OMOP concept - VOCABULARY_ID = 'JNJ_OPTUM_P_SPCLTY'.
-   Remove duplicate records before assigning PROVIDER_ID.
