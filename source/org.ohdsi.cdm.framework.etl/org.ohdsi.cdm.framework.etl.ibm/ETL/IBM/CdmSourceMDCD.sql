		   'Truven Health MarketScan® Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD) adjudicated US health insurance claims for Medicaid enrollees from multiple states and includes hospital discharge diagnoses, outpatient diagnoses and procedures, and outpatient pharmacy claims as well  as ethnicity and Medicare eligibility.  Members maintain their same identifier even if they leave the system for a brief period however the dataset lacks lab data. 

The major data elements contained within this database are outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims (coded with National Drug Codes (NDC), inpatient and outpatient medical claims which provide procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCs, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS) and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM).  The data does not contain laboratory results.

           ('Visit','A standardized definition of visit logic is applied to our U.S. claims data.  The data vendors do apply methods to define inpatient, outpatient, ER and long term care visits however we have found inconsistencies between the data vendors of claims data.  Inpatient visits defined by Truven remain as IP unless they have a revenue code suggesting it is actually an ER visit.  Additionally outpatient service charges that are associated to room and board are categorized as inpatient.  ER or outpatient services during the middle of an inpatient stay are associated to that inpatient stay.  To learn additional information please refer to the publication:
