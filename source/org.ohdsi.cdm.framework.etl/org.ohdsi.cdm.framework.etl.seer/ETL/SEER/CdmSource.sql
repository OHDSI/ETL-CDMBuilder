Inpatient visits defined by Medicare remain as IP unless they have a indicator suggesting it is actually a long-term care visit. Outpatient, physician, and device services during the middle of an inpatient stay are associated to that inpatient stay. Remaining outpatient claims are considered outpatient visits unless they have a revenue code suggesting they are actually ER visits.
